# FIRST PART

i had to do it the easiest 
way for you otherwise it's confusing and 
i had to sign 
it individually instead of letting my 
 other apps that do it so i can 
upload it otherwise it installs
 directly which wouldn't be 
helpful that's why it took so long ðŸ˜­

1. download the .ipa to your phone,
 
2. go to ipasigner, website linked with the ipa

3. i'm going to give you the uuid 
otherwise you can't do it but don't 
share it cause it'll get revoked if too
many people are using it 

4. upload the .ipa to the website press install
and tada you finessed the system 

go to releases below this to get the stuff
